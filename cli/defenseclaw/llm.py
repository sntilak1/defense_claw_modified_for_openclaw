"""defenseclaw-llm — LiteLLM-backed subprocess bridge.

Called by the TypeScript plugin scanner (``@defenseclaw/plugin-scanner``)
and any other out-of-process component that needs to talk to an LLM
without pulling in the full DefenseClaw Python dependency tree on its
own. Uses LiteLLM's :func:`litellm.completion` so every provider
LiteLLM supports — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, Bedrock, Groq,
Mistral, DeepSeek, Fireworks, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, OpenRouter,
Together.ai, etc. — works through the same bridge with no SDK-specific
branching here.

Routing precedence (high → low) for each field:

1. Explicit JSON request field (``model``, ``api_key``, ``api_base``,
   ``provider``, ``temperature``, ``max_tokens``).
2. The unified :class:`defenseclaw.config.LLMConfig` resolved at
   ``scanners.plugin`` — top-level ``llm:`` merged with
   ``scanners.plugin.llm:`` overrides. This is where
   ``DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY`` / ``DEFENSECLAW_LLM_MODEL`` land.
3. Provider-specific env vars (``OPENAI_API_KEY``, ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``,
   …) that LiteLLM reads on its own as a last resort.

Guardrail bypass:
    By design, the plugin scanner does NOT route through Bifrost.
    Running DefenseClaw's own guardrails against third-party plugin
    source code would double-bill operators and add latency for no
    security benefit — the scanner IS the guardrail layer. If you want
    guardrails on this path, stand Bifrost up separately and point
    ``api_base`` at it.

Usage::

    echo '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514","messages":[...]}' \\
        | python -m defenseclaw.llm

Input (stdin JSON) — every field is optional except ``messages``::

    {
        "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."},
                     {"role": "user",   "content": "..."}],
        "max_tokens": 8192,
        "temperature": 0.0,
        "api_key": "...",
        "api_base": "...",
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "timeout": 60,
        "max_retries": 2
    }

Output (stdout JSON)::

    {
        "content": "...",
        "model":   "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "usage":   {"prompt_tokens": N,
                    "completion_tokens": N,
                    "total_tokens": N},
